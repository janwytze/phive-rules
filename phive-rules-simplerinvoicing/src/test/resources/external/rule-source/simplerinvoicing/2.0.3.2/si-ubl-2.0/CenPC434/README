The CEN rules are based on
https://github.com/ConnectingEurope/eInvoicing-EN16931
commit 18530d4f0bcb72094342465f15b100c9a41f1c3c
(tag validation-1.3.6)

There is one additional modification for rule BR-CO-15: the check was
changed to only consider cac:TaxTotal/cbc:TaxAmount on the document level,
not every instance of this field. This is to accomodate for extensions that
also use cac:TaxTotal/cbc:TaxAmount in other places.

See https://github.com/ConnectingEurope/eInvoicing-EN16931/issues/257 for
more information.
